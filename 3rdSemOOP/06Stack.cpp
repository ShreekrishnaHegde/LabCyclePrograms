/*
Write a C++ program to create a class called STACK using an array of integers. Implement
the following operations by overloading the operators + and -.
1. s1 = s1 + element; where s1 is an object of the class STACK and element is an
integer to be pushed on the top of the stack.
2. s1 = s1 - ; where s1 is an object of the class STACK â€“ operator pops the element.
Handle the STACK empty and STACK full conditions. Also display the contents ofthe stack
after each operation, by overloading the operator<<.
